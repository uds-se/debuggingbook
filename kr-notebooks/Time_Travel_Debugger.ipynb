    "If you work as a **team of two**, this is the part you will _also_ have to build.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a GUI in Jupyter notebooks, one can follow two paths:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use embeddings of plain HTML/JS into the notebook (see Exercise 3 in the [chapter on interactive debuggers](Debugger.ipynb). This has the advantage of not requiring Python in the final result; your time travel debugger can execute in any browser. You may follow this path if you already have experience with Web design and programming.\n",
    "2. Use [Jupyter widgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) to create a user interface. This has the advantage that you can use Python all along the way. Your debugger, however, can only be run in the notebook; not in, say, a Web page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your GUI-based time travel debugger should implement similar features as the command line debugger, but its functionality should be accessible via a graphical user interface (instead of typing in the commands).\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, a user may be able to step backward by clicking a ◀ button, or set a breakpoint by clicking on a line in the code view.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Presentation\" section should include a video/YouTube (up to 1 min each) embedded in Jupyter Notebook, which shows a demo of each implemented feature."
