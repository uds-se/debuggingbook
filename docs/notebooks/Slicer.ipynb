    "# Tracking Failure Origins\n",
    "\n",
    "The question of \"Where does this value come from?\" is fundamental for debugging. Which earlier variables could possibly have influenced the current erroneous state? And how did their values come to be?\n",
    "\n",
    "When programmers read code during debugging, they scan it for potential _origins_ of given values. This can be a tedious experience, notably, if the origins spread across multiple separate locations, possibly even in different modules. In this chapter, we thus investigate means to _determine such origins_ automatically – by collecting data and control dependencies during program execution."

    "<!-- Automatically generated. Do not edit. -->\n",
    "\n",
    "To [use the code provided in this chapter](Importing.ipynb), write\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> from debuggingbook.Slicer import <identifier>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and then make use of the following features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter provides a `Slicer` class to automatically determine and visualize dynamic flows and dependencies. When we say that a variable $x$ _depends_ on a variable $y$ (and that $y$ _flows_ into $x$), we distinguish two kinds of dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data dependency**: $x$ is assigned a value computed from $y$.\n",
    "* **Control dependency**: A statement involving $x$ is executed _only_ because a _condition_ involving $y$ was evaluated, influencing the execution path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such dependencies are crucial for debugging, as they allow to determine the origins of individual values (and notably incorrect values). \n",
    "\n",
    "To determine dynamic dependencies in a function `func`, use\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with Slicer() as slicer:\n",
    "    <Some call to func()>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and then `slicer.graph()` or `slicer.code()` to examine dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also explicitly specify the functions to be instrumented, as in \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with Slicer(func, func_1, func_2) as slicer:\n",
    "    <Some call to func()>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example. The `demo()` function computes some number from `x`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> def demo(x: int) -> int:\n",
    ">>>     z = x\n",
    ">>>     while x <= z <= 64:\n",
    ">>>         z *= 2\n",
    ">>>     return z\n",
    "```\n",
    "By using `with Slicer()`, we first instrument `demo()` and then execute it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> with Slicer() as slicer:\n",
    ">>>     demo(10)\n",
    "```\n",
    "After execution is complete, you can output `slicer` to visualize the dependencies and flows as graph. Data dependencies are shown as black solid edges; control dependencies are shown as grey dashed edges. The arrows indicate influence: If $y$ depends on $x$ (and thus $x$ flows into $y$), then we have an arrow $x \\rightarrow y$.\n",
    "We see how the parameter `x` flows into `z`, which is returned after some computation that is control dependent on a `<test>` involving `z`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> slicer\n",
    "```\n",
    "![](PICS/Slicer-synopsis-1.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternate representation is `slicer.code()`, annotating the instrumented source code with (backward) dependencies. Data dependencies are shown with `<=`, control dependencies with `<-`; locations (lines) are shown in parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> slicer.code()\n",
    "*    1 def demo(x: int) -> int:\n",
    "*    2     z = x  # <= x (1)\n",
    "*    3     while x <= z <= 64:  # <= x (1), z (2), z (4)\n",
    "*    4         z *= 2  # <= z (2), z (4); <- <test> (3)\n",
    "*    5     return z  # <= z (4)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Dependencies can also be retrieved programmatically. The `dependencies()` method returns a `Dependencies` object encapsulating the dependency graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method `all_vars()` returns all variables in the dependency graph. Each variable is encoded as a pair (_name_, _location_) where _location_ is a pair (_codename_, _lineno_).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> slicer.dependencies().all_vars()\n",
    "{('<demo() return value>', (<function __main__.demo(x: int) -> int>, 5)),\n",
    " ('<test>', (<function __main__.demo(x: int) -> int>, 3)),\n",

    " ('z', (<function __main__.demo(x: int) -> int>, 2)),\n",
    " ('z', (<function __main__.demo(x: int) -> int>, 4))}\n",
    "```\n",
    "`code()` and `graph()` methods can also be applied on dependencies. The method `backward_slice(var)` returns a backward slice for the given variable (again given as a pair (_name_, _location_)). To retrieve where `z` in Line 2 came from, use:\n",

    "```python\n",
    ">>> _, start_demo = inspect.getsourcelines(demo)\n",

    "2. Whenever a function is about to be called (`DataTracker.call()`)\n",

Both Korel and Laski \\cite{Korel1988} as well as Agrawal and Horgan \\cite{Agrawal1990} introduced _dynamic_ program slicing, building on _dynamic_ dependencies, which would be more specific to a given (failing) run. (The `Slicer` we implement in this chapter is a dynamic slicer.) Tip \\cite{Tip1995} gives a survey on program slicing techniques. Chen et al. \\cite{Chen2014} describe and evaluate the first dynamic slicer for Python programs (which is independent of our implementation)."
