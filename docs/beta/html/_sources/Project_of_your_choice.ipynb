    "### Statistical Invariant Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the invariant templates (say, X < Y) from [dynamic invariants](DynamicInvariants.ipynb), find out which properties correlate with failure, as in [statistical debugging](StatisticalDebugger.ipynb): “middle() fails when x < z < y”.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploring Flows\n",
    "\n",
    "Add commands to the [interactive debugger](Debugger.ipynb) such that one can track where a particular value came from, using [slicer](Slicer.ipynb): “enter 'origin x’; get ‘from y in Line 35’)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mining Co-Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "Pick some git project. Which files are most frequently changed together? Visualize. Uses [mining changes](ChangeCounter.ipynb): “Sitemap.html and 404.html are always changed together”."
