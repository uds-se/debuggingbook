The Debugging Book - Debugging Performance Issues

This file can be _executed_ as a script, running all experiments:

    $ python PerformanceDebugger.py

or _imported_ as a package, providing classes, functions, and constants:

    >>> from debuggingbook.PerformanceDebugger import <identifier>
    
but before you do so, _read_ it and _interact_ with it at:

    https://www.debuggingbook.org/html/PerformanceDebugger.html

_For those only interested in using the code in this chapter (without wanting to know how it works), give an example.  This will be copied to the beginning of the chapter (before the first section) as text with rendered input and output._
