    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind _statistical debugging_ is fairly simple. We have a program that sometimes passes and sometimes fails. This outcome can be _correlated_ with events that precede it – properties of the input, properties of the execution, properties of the program state. If we, for instance, can find that \"the program always fails when Line 123 is executed, and it always passes when Line 123 is _not_ executed\", then we have a strong correlation between Line 123 being executed and failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such _correlation_ does not necessarily mean _causation_. For this, we would have to prove that executing Line 123 _always_ leads to failure, and that _not_ executing it does not lead to (this) failure. Also, a correlation (or even a causation) does not mean that Line 123 contains the defect – for this, we would have to show that it actually is an error. Still, correlations make excellent hints as it comes to search for failure causes – in all generality, if you let your search be guided by _events that correlate with failures_, you are more likely to find _important hints on how the failure comes to be_."

We will show how this works for two \"correlation\" metrics – first the _Tarantula_ metric, as introduced above, and then the _Ochiai_ metric, which has shown to be one of the best \"ranking\" metrics."

The standard method to evaluate such rankings is to determine a _ground truth_ – that is, the set of locations that eventually are fixed – and to check at which point in the ranking any such location occurs – the earlier, the better. In our `remove_html_markup()` and `middle()` examples, both the Tarantula and the Ochiai metric perform flawlessly, as the \"culprit\" line is always ranked at the top. However, this need not always be the case; the exact performance depends on the nature of the code and the observed runs.

At this point, a _visualization_ as in the Tarantula tool can be helpful to programmers as it _guides_ the search, but a _ranking_ that _defines_ where to search may be less useful."
