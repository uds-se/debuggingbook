In particular, we want to explore techniques that _automatically_ answer questions like: Where is the bug? When does it occur? And how can we repair it? But before we start automating the debugging process, we first need to understand what this process is.\n",

    "### Understanding Python Programs\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're new to Python, you might first have to understand what the above code does.  We very much recommend the [Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) to get an idea on how Python works.  The most important things for you to understand the above code are these three:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python structures programs through _indentation_, so the function and `for` bodies are defined by being indented.\n",
    "2. Python is _dynamically typed_, meaning that the type of variables like `c`, `tag`, or `out` is determined at run-time.\n",
    "3. Most of Python's syntactic features are inspired by other common languages, such as control structures (`while`, `if`, `for`), assignments (`=`), or comparisons (`==`, `!=`, `<`).\n",
    "\n",
    "With that, you can already understand what the above code does: `remove_html_markup()` takes a (HTML) string `s` and then iterates over the individual characters (`for c in s`). By default, these characters are added to the return string `out`. However, if `remove_html_markup()` finds a `<` character, it sets the `tag` flag, meaning that all further characters are ignored until a `>` character is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to other languages, Python makes no difference between strings and characters – there are only strings. As in HTML, strings can be enclosed in single quotes (`'a'`) and in double quotes (`\"a\"`). This is useful if you want to specify a string that contains quotes, as in `'She said \"hello\", and then left'` or `\"The first character is a 'c'\"`"

    "* We have a program (execution), taking some input and producing some output.\n",
    "* The output is in *error* (✘), meaning an unwanted and unintended deviation from what is correct, right, or true.\n",

If the input is under control of a third party, though (which typically is the case for _system inputs_), your program must check its correctness and reject it if it is incorrect. Once your program accepts a system input as valid, it must be properly processed by the program in question.\n",

Unfortunately, it is not, and that's partly due to the lack of specifications.\n",

This technique is called *rubber duck debugging* or *rubberducking* – the idea is that you explain your problem to a rubber duck first before interrupting one of your co-workers with the problem. Some programmers, when asked for advice, explicitly request that you \"explain your problem to the duck first\", knowing that this resolves a good fraction of problems."

In the end, though, we have to face the fact: We made the bugs, and they are ours to fix.\n",

    "1. An _error_ is a deviation from what is correct, right, or true. Specifically,\n",
    "    * A _mistake_ is a human act or decision resulting in an error.\n",
    "    * A _defect_ is an error in the program code. Also called *bug*.\n",
    "    * A _fault_ is an error in the program state. Also called *infection*.\n",
    "    * A _failure_ is an externally visible error in the program behavior. Also called *malfunction*.\n",
    "2. In a failing program execution, a mistake by the programmer results in a defect in the code, which creates a fault in the state, which propagates until it results in a failure. Tracing back fault propagation allows identifying the defect that causes the failure.\n",

    "* _Why Programs Fail_ by Zeller \\cite{zeller2009-why-programs-fail} takes a more academic approach, creating theories of how failures come to be and systematic debugging processes;\n",

Notably, a string that begins with a double quote may be interpreted as ending when a single quote is seen, and vice versa. Here's an example of such a string:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<b title=\"<Shakespeare's play>\">foo</b>\n",
    "```"
   ]
  },

   "source": [
    "When we remove the HTML markup, the `>` in the string is interpreted as _unquoted_. Hence, it is interpreted as ending the tag, such that the rest of the tag is not removed."
   ]
