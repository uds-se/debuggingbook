    "# Mining Function Specifications\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [chapter on assertions](Assertions.ipynb), we have seen how important it is to _check_ whether the result is as expected.  In this chapter, we introduce a technique that allows us to _mine_ function specifications from a set of given executions, resulting in abstract and formal _descriptions_ of what the function expects and what it delivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "These so-called _dynamic invariants_ produce pre- and post-conditions over function arguments and variables from a set of executions. Within debugging, the resulting _assertions_ can immediately check whether function behavior has changed, but can also be useful to determine the characteristics of _failing_ runs (as opposed to _passing_ runs). Furthermore, the resulting specifications provide pre- and postconditions for formal program proofs, testing, and verification.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter is based on [a chapter with the same name in The Fuzzing Book](https://www.fuzzingbook.org/html/DynamicInvariants.html), which focuses on test generation."

(Just take a look at the chapters in this book.)  This is a pity: As Ken Thompson famously said, \"Without specifications, there are no bugs – only surprises\".  It is also a problem for debugging, since, of course, debugging needs some specification such that we know what is wrong, and how to fix it.  This raises the interesting question: Can we somehow _retrofit_ existing code with \"specifications\" that properly describe their behavior, allowing developers to simply _check_ them rather than having to write them from scratch?

    "For our Python code, one of the most important \"specifications\" we need is *types*.  Python being a \"dynamically\" typed language means that all data types are determined at run time; the code itself does not explicitly state whether a variable is an integer, a string, an array, a dictionary – or whatever."

    "As _writer_ of Python code, omitting explicit type declarations may save time (and allows for some fun hacks).  It is not sure whether a lack of types helps in _reading_ and _understanding_ code for humans.  For a _computer_ trying to analyze code, the lack of explicit types is detrimental.  If, say, a constraint solver, sees `if x:` and cannot know whether `x` is supposed to be a number or a string, this introduces an _ambiguity_.   Such ambiguities may multiply over the entire analysis in a combinatorial explosion – or in the analysis yielding an overly inaccurate result."

    "The [DAIKON dynamic invariant detector](https://plse.cs.washington.edu/daikon/) can be considered the mother of function specification miners.  Continuously maintained and extended for more than 20 years, it mines likely invariants in the style of this chapter for a variety of languages, including C, C++, C#, Eiffel, F#, Java, Perl, and Visual Basic.  On top of the functionality discussed above, it holds a rich catalog of patterns for likely invariants, supports data invariants, can eliminate invariants that are implied by others, and determines statistical confidence to disregard unlikely invariants.  The corresponding paper \\cite{Ernst2001} is one of the seminal and most-cited papers of Software Engineering.  A multitude of works have been published based on DAIKON and detecting invariants; see this [curated list](http://plse.cs.washington.edu/daikon/pubs/) for details."
