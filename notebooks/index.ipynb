This book addresses this problem by _automating_ software debugging, specifically by _locating errors and their causes automatically_.  Recent years have seen the development of novel techniques that lead to dramatic improvements in automated software debugging.  They now are mature enough to be assembled in a book – even with executable code. \n",

    "\n",
    "The interactive notebook uses the [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org) service, which runs notebooks on their own servers.  Starting Jupyter through mybinder.org normally takes about 30 seconds, depending on your Internet connection. If, however, you are the first to invoke binder after a book update, binder recreates its environment, which will take a few minutes. Subsequent launches will be much faster."

    "\n",
    "> As mybinder.org is a research pilot project, the main goal for the project is to understand usage patterns and workloads for future project evolution.

    "#### Do your techniques apply to Python programs only? How about C code?\n",
    "\n",
    "We use Python to implement our tools and techniques because we can get things done *quickly.* Building an [interactive debugger](Debugger.ipynb) in Python is less than 100 lines of code and took us 2-3 days; doing the same for C is tens of thousands of lines and a year-long project. Instrumenting code, say for [dynamic slicing](Slicer.ipynb), gets us savings of similar magnitude. Also, Python code allows us (and you) to focus on the main concepts, rather than implementation details that are out of place in a textbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having said this, many of the techniques in this book can also be applied to C and other code. This is notably true for _black-box_ techniques such as [reducing inputs](DeltaDebugger.ipynb) or [changes](ChangeDebugger.ipynb) or [generalizers](DDSetDebugger.ipynb); these are all language-agnostic. Tools related to the debugging process such as [bug tracking](Tracking.ipynb) or [mining repositories](ChangeCounter.ipynb) are language-agnostic as well. Finally, in all chapters, we provide pointers to implementations in and for other languages, for instance for [assertions](Assertions.ipynb) or [program repair](Repairer.ipynb)."
