Developers often take elaborated guesses on which aspects of their code impact performance, and think about all possible ways to optimize their code – and at the same time, making it harder to understand, harder to evolve, and harder to maintain. In most cases, such guesses are wrong. Instead, _measure_ performance of your program, _identify_ the very few parts that may need to get improved, and again _measure_ the impact of your changes."
