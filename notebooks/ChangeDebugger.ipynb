    "When you develop software, it is unlikely that you will be able to produce a fully working piece of software right from the beginning – hence the need for debugging. It is just as unlikely, though, that your software will stay _unchanged_ forever. Evolving requirements, the introduction of new technology, changes in the environment all induce software changes – and every such change brings the risk of introducing new bugs.\n",

    "To detect such bugs introduced by changes, systematic (and best automatic) _testing_, notably _regression testing_, can be a big help; in fact, the more comprehensive and the more automated your testing strategy is, the more it actually _enables_ evolving your software, because every new test lowers the risk of a change introducing a bug. Extensive testing is what enables agile development – and we're happy to point to our [sibling book on test generation](https://www.fuzzingbook.org) to give you some inspiration on how to do this.\n",

    "\n",
    "The concept of \"bisecting\" as traversing a version history to identify failure-inducing changes was first described by Brian Ness and Viet Ngo from Cray Research as \"Source change isolation\" \\cite{Ness1997}. The abstract of their paper summarizes the goals and benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Effective regression containment is an important factor in the design of development and testing processes for large software projects, especially when many developers are doing concurrent work on a common set of sources. Source change isolation provides an inexpensive, mechanical alternative to analytical methods for identifying the cause of software regressions. It also provides the advantage of enabling regressions to be eliminated by reversing the effect of source changes that introduced errant behavior, without the need to write new code, and without halting other development work on the same software. Deliverability is also improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Delta Debugging on changes (and also Delta Debugging) was introduced in \"Yesterday, my program worked. Today, it does not. Why?\" \\cite{Zeller1999}, a paper which would win an ACM SIGSOFT Impact Paper Award ten years later.\n",
    "This paper generalized over \\cite{Ness1997} by identifying failure-inducing differences in arbitrary sets of changes. \\cite{Zeller2002} generalized the algorithm to work on inputs and other collections (including changes); the [chapter on delta debugging](DeltaDebugger), which we use in this chapter, uses the \\cite{Zeller2002} formulation of the `dd` algorithm."
