This is the job of dedicated _bug tracking systems_, which we will discuss (and demo) in this chapter."

    "\n",
    "The survey by Bettenburg et al. \\cite{Bettenburg2008} is the seminal work on how developers make use of bug reports. The study by Bertram et al. \\cite{Bertram2010} highlights how issue trackers are not just databases, but \"a focal point for communication and coordination for many stakeholders within and beyond the software team.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The report by \\cite{Glerum2009} provides details on how _Windows Error Reporting_ automates the processing of error reports coming from an installed base of a billion machines, providing impressive numbers on bugs in the wild.\n",
    "\n",
    "Research on bug databases has very much focused on how to make predictions such as automatically identifying duplicates \\cite{Wang2008}, possible bug locations \\cite{Kim2013}, or automatically assigning issues to developers \\cite{Anvik2006}. Herzig et al.  \\cite{Herzig2013}, however point out that much of the information in bug database is not classified properly enough, for instance to reliably distinguish between bugs and features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mozilla's [Bugzilla bug database](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/) is one of the largest publicly available issue databases. It is worth browsing for real-world bug reports, and also contains important articles on how to write and use bug reports."
