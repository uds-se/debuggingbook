    "* Automated repair based on genetic optimization uses five ingredients:\n",
    "    1. A _test suite_ to determine passing and failing tests\n",
    "    2. _Defect localization_ (typically obtained from [statistical debugging](StatisticalDebugger.ipynb) with the test suite) to determine potential locations to be fixed\n",
    "    3. _Random code mutations_ and _crossover operations_ to create and evolve a population of inputs\n",
    "    4. A _fitness function_ and a _selection strategy_ to determine the part of the population that should be evolved further\n",
    "    5. A _reducer_ such as [delta debugging](DeltaDebugger.ipynb) to simplify the final candidate with the highest fitness.\n",
    "* The result of automated repair is a _fix candidate_ with the highest fitness for the given tests.\n",
    "* A _fix candidate_ is not guaranteed to be correct or optimal, but gives important hints on how to fix the program.\n",
    "* All of the above ingredients offer plenty of settings and alternatives to experiment with."

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The seminal work in automated repair is [GenProg](https://squareslab.github.io/genprog-code/) \\cite{LeGoues2012}, which heavily inspired our `Repairer` implementation. Major differences between GenProg and `Repairer` include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* GenProg includes its own defect localization (which is also dynamically updated), whereas `Repairer` builds on earlier statistical debugging.\n",
    "* GenProg can apply multiple mutations on programs (or none at all), whereas `Repairer` applies exactly one mutation.\n",
    "* The `StatementMutator` used by `Repairer` includes various special cases for program structures (`if`, `for`, `while`...), whereas GenProg operates on statements only.\n",
    "* GenProg has been tested on large production programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "While GenProg is _the_ seminal work in the area (and arguably the most important software engineering research contribution of the 2010s), there have been a number of important extensions of automated repair. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *AutoFix* \\cite{Pei2014} leverages _program contracts_ (pre- and postconditions) to generate tests and assertions automatically. Not only do such [assertions](Assertions.ipynb) help in fault localization, they also allow for much better validation of fix candidates.\n",
    "* *SemFix* \\cite{Nguyen2013} presents automated program repair based on _symbolic analysis_ rather than genetic optimization. This allows to leverage program semantics, which GenProg does not consider.\n",
    "\n",
