    "In the previous chapters on [tracing](Tracer.ipynb) and [interactive debugging](Debugger.ipynb), we have seen how to observe executions. By checking our observations against our expectations, we can find out when and how the program state is faulty. So far, we have assumed that this check would be done by _humans_ – that is, us. However, having this check done by a _computer_, for instance as part of the execution, is infinitely more rigorous and efficient. In this chapter, we introduce techniques to _specify_ our expectations and to check them at runtime, enabling us to detect faults _right as they occur_."

    "By default, failing assertions are not exactly user-friendly – the diagnosis they provide is of interest to the code maintainers only.  Think of how your application should handle internal errors as discovered by assertions (or the runtime system). Simply exiting (as assertions on C do) may not be the best option for critical software. Think about implementing your own assert functions with appropriate recovery methods."

    "\n",
    "The usage of _assertions_ goes back to the earliest days of programming. In 1947, Neumann and Goldstine defined _assertion boxes_ that would check the limits of specific variables. In his 1949 talk [\"Checking a Large Routine\"](http://www.turingarchive.org/browse.php/B/8), Alan Turing suggested\n",
    "\n",
    "> How can one check a large routine in the sense of making sure that it's right? In order that the man who checks may not have too difficult a task, the programmer should make a number of definite _assertions_ which can be checked individually, and from which the correctness of the whole program easily follows.\n",

    "[Valgrind](https://valgrind.org) originated as an academic tool which has seen lots of industrial usage. A [list of papers](https://www.valgrind.org/docs/pubs.html) is available on the Valgrind page.\n",
